# targetedthreats

Collection of IOCs related to targeting of civil society.
If you're interested, I also compile a list of [Reports](https://github.com/botherder/targetedthreats/wiki/Reports) detailing attacks
against activists, dissidents and journalists.

The file **targetedthreats.csv** contains a list of network indicators in CSV format.

The file **targetedthreats.json** is the JSON conversation of the CSV list.

The file **targetedthreats.rules** contains Snort rules automatically generated from the CSV list.

The file **samples.csv** contains a list of file hashes extracted from all the
collected reports.
